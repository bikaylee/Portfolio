#### Pixel Jump <small>Artificial Intelligence with Malmo</small>

Oct 2020 - Dec 2020

_UC Irvine, CS175_

- Deep Reinforcement Learning: Jumping game simulation using Malmo. The agent learns from the reward system based on its actions. The environment is difficult with enormous action space in which the agent can choose the initial velocity and degree from a range of continuous data points.
- Proximal Policy Optimization: The algorithm makes updates based on the transitions that were obtained by the current policy and is used in the agent’s decision for better performance.
- Classical Mechanics: Jumping simulation is based on the 3D projectile motion calculation.
